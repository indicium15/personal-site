title: About Me
---

Hi! I'm Chaitanya, a recently graduated Computer Science student from NTU.

I created this website to share my personal projects, get back to writing, and keep track of the things I’m working on. I’ve always been drawn to emerging technologies and their real-world applications, and my time at NTU gave me the chance to explore this curiosity through some interesting projects, many of which I’ll be documenting here.

Lately, I’ve been especially interested in applying machine learning and AI to sports analytics. With new skills under my belt, I’m excited to re-enter the space. I want to make this website the place where I share updates and ideas along the way.
